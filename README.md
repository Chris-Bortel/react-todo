[Click here to see phase 1 document](docs/phase1.md)

## Business Requirements

The To Do Manager application has the following overall requirements:

- Designed to match the mock-up
  - Header, Main Section Footer
  - Use React [Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for styling and visual components

- The header should present the application title and main menu
  - Home Link, which shows the list of To Do Items as noted below
  - A Login/Register/User section
    - When a user is **not logged in**:
      - Show Login and Register links
        - Login: Renders a Login Form
        - Register: Renders a new user registration form
          - Require Fields:: Username, Password, Email, Role

    - When a user **is logged in**:
      - Show “Welcome username”
      - Show a “Logout” link
        - When clicked, this should remove any cookies you have set and remove access

- In the “Main” section
  - Nothing should be visible until a user has logged in successfully
  - **The list of items in the to do list**
    - Based on user preferences, show listings in groups of (5, 10, etc) and provide the ability to view multiple “pages” of results
    - Each item in list should show the text of the item as well as the assignee
      - Based on user preferences, hide or show completed items
      - If shown, completed items should be styled differently making their status visually obvious

    - For users with “Update” permissions
      - When an item is clicked, toggle the “complete” status of the item.

    - For users with “Delete” permissions
      - Items should have a delete button associated with them
        - When clicked, remove the item from the list

    - For users with “Create” permissions …
      - **A Form where the user can a new item to the todo list**
        - Items should have the following fields:
          - To Do Item Text
          - Assigned To
          - Status (complete/incomplete)
          - Difficulty (number between 1 and 5)
          - i.e.

            ```javascript
            const todo = mongoose.Schema({
              text: { type: String, required: true },
              assignee: { type: String },
              complete: { type: Boolean, default:false },
              difficulty: { type: Number, default: 1 },
            });
            ```

## Technical Requirements

The application will be created with the following overall architecture and methodologies

1. React
2. ES6 Classes
3. Settings delivered to the application using Context
4. User Login & Permissions delivered to the application using Context
5. Local Storage / Cookies for storing login status
6. Local Storage / Cookies for storing user preferences
7. Superagent or Axios for performing API Requests
8. React Bootstrap for styling
9. Test Driven Development, using Jest
     - Tests will be runnable locally
10. Deployment to cloud provider

## Development Process, Milestones

At every stage of development, the application should be publicly deployed

1. Phase 1: Application Setup
    - Basic To Do List Management, using Hooks

2. Phase 2: Persistence
    - Implement a custom Form Hook
    - Implement a custom Ajax Hook
    - Connect to a live API for storing To Do Items

3. Phase 3: Settings and Global Context
    - Implement user settings for displaying items

4. Phase 4: Authorization
    - Require a login to access the list
    - Restrict access to adding, editing, deleting to certain user types
